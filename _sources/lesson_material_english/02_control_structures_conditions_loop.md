# Control Structures and Conditions

## Scripts and Programs

Programming often involves executing multiple commands in sequence. When such commands are written together and executed in an integrated development environment (IDE) like **Spyder**, we refer to this as a **script** or a **program**.

### Difference Between Script and Program

The terms **script** and **program** are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference:

- **Script**: A simple, often shorter piece of code that fulfills a specific task. Scripts are typically used for smaller, temporary tasks.
- **Program**: A larger and more complex software product with extensive functions and structures.

In this course, we use the terms largely synonymously.

+ Program $\approx$ Script (and Program > Script)

**Example of a small script:**
```python
fruit = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "pear"]
juice_choice = 1
ice_choice = 2
print(fruit[juice_choice] + " juice")  # or: print(f"{fruit[juice_choice]} juice")
print(fruit[ice_choice] + " ice cream")
```

> What does this script output?
> 1) apple juice, orange ice cream  
> 2) orange juice, banana ice cream  
> 3) banana juice, orange ice cream  
> 4) I don't know! I'd have to guess (but I won't).  

Hmm, pretty boring program.  
Letâ€™s make it more interactive by adding user input:

### User Input

A common feature of interactive programs is the ability to process user input. In Python, this is done using the `input()` function:

<!-- pytest-codeblocks:skip -->
```python
my_str = input("Enter a string: ")
print(my_str)  # => Outputs the entered string
```

We can make our previous fruit script more interactive:

<!-- pytest-codeblocks:skip -->
```python
fruit = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "pear"]
print(f"We have: {fruit}")
fruit_choice = input("Please enter your choice: ")
print(f"Here is your {fruit_choice} ice cream!")
```

### Quiz:

> What happens if I enter "Ketchup"?  
> a) Here is your Ketchup ice cream!  
> b) ValueError  
> c) We have no Ketchup ice cream!  

This leads us to the question:  
How can we check if our choice exists?  
Earlier, we briefly covered the `xxx in my_list` check for sequences. This is already a condition, and conditions in Python can be evaluated in various ways:

## Conditions

Conditions are a central component of almost every program, enabling decisions based on the state of the data. A condition is a simple logical statement that is either **true** (`True`) or **false** (`False`).

### Comparison Operators

In Python, various comparison operators are used to create conditions:

```python
9 < 10  # => True

print(3 < 4 < 5)  # => True

print(4.0 == 4)  # => True

print(4.01 == 4)  # => False

"apple" < "banana"  # => True (Python uses alphabetical order: a < b)

"apple" != "pear"  # => True
```

### Difference Between `is` and `==`

A common beginner mistake is confusing `is` and `==`. These operators have different meanings:

- `==` checks whether two objects have the **same value**.
- `is` checks whether two objects point to the **same memory address**, i.e., are identical.

```python
a = 12345678
b = 12345678
print(a == b)  # => True
```

But with `is`, we get a different result:
```python
print(a is b)  # => False
```

#### Why the difference?

Variables in Python reference values stored somewhere in memory.  
`is` checks whether two objects are the same and stored at the same memory address. This can also be verified using the `id()` function:

```python
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(id(a) != id(b))  # => True
```

![Assigning Variables](../images/python_assign_variables.png)

In practice, we rarely use `is` in this context. However, understanding what happens "under the hood" helps with another important distinction in Python: **mutable** and **immutable** data types.

### Mutable vs. Immutable Data Types

- **Mutable Data Types**: Values can be dynamically changed. Examples include lists, sets, and dictionaries.
- **Immutable Data Types**: Values cannot be changed after assignment. Examples include integers, floats, booleans, strings, and tuples.

Example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
print(fruits[-1])  # -> mango

# Lists are mutable:
fruits[-1] = "orange"
print(fruits[-1])  # -> orange

# Tuples are immutable:
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "mango")
print(fruits[-1])  # -> mango

fruits[-1] = "orange"  # -> TypeError
```

---

### Logical Operators

Python provides logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` for combining conditions:

```python
True and False  # => False
True or False  # => True
```

Example:

```python
a = 4
a < 0 or a > 3  # => True
```

### Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)

Conditions and logical checks allow us to control program flow and implement "decision-making" in our programs.

Example of a simple `if` statement:
```python
number = 0.01
if number >= 0:
    print(f"{number} is positive.")
```

For more complex decisions, use `if-else` or `if-elif-else` structures.

Example with `if-else`:
```python
number = 0.01   
if number >= 0:
    print(f"{number} is a positive number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is a negative number.")
```

Example with `if-elif-else`:
```python
number = 0.01
if number > 0:
    print(f"{number} is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print(f"{number} is negative.") 
else:
    print(f"{number} must be 0.")
```

### Loops

Loops are another fundamental control structure in Python. They allow you to repeat code while a condition is met. Loops can also combine with conditional statements to create more complex workflows.

#### While Loop

The `while` loop repeats code as long as a specified condition is `True`. 

Example:
```python
x = 2
while x < 1000:
    x = x**2
    print(x)
```

#### For Loop

The `for` loop iterates over elements of a sequence or range:

```python
for char in "Python":
    print(char)

for num in range(5):
    print(num)
```

### List Comprehensions

A concise way to create lists using loops is a list comprehension:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
squared = [x**2 for x in my_list]
print(squared)  # => [1, 4, 9]
```
```python
print([s[0] for s in ["eins", "zwei", "drei"]])  
# => ['e', 'z', 'd']
```
