**About me**
I work as a Professor of Data Science at the [Hochschule Düsseldorf (HSD)](https://www.hs-duesseldorf.de/). There, I teach students the fundamentals of Data Science, programming with Python, and Machine Learning, or offer unsolicited advice on coffee, chocolate, and all the other things that truly matter in life.
